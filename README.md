# ✈️ **Flight Insights: Data Cleaning and EDA**

This project focuses on **data quality checks** and **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** for a **flight delays dataset**. It showcases my ability to clean and prepare raw data, assess data quality, and generate meaningful insights through descriptive statistics and reporting using **R**.

The report highlights techniques for handling time-based data, managing missing values, and creating a structured data quality report to guide further analysis.

## 📊 **Project Overview**

The **Flight Insights** project covers:

- **Data Cleaning**: Identifying and handling missing values, empty strings, and incorrect time formats.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Calculating key descriptive statistics for continuous features like delay minutes and flight distance.
- **Data Quality Reporting**: Generating a detailed quality report to evaluate the completeness and distribution of key variables.
